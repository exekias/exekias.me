    suggest the last because of the mention of essential as a component in another

<p>As Ignacio <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.ebox-platform.com&#47;icorreas&#47;2010&#47;08&#47;05&#47;changing-the-name-of-ebox-platform&#47;">announced<&#47;a>, eBox has changed its name! Roxane explained the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.ebox-platform.com&#47;gueststars&#47;2010&#47;08&#47;12&#47;the-process-of-choosing-a-new-name-for-ebox&#47;">process of choosing a new name<&#47;a> and Heidi has finally <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.ebox-platform.com&#47;heidi&#47;2010&#47;08&#47;19&#47;the-new-name-for-ebox-platform-is-zentyal&#47;">unveiled it<&#47;a>. <strong>eBox Platform becomes <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.zentyal.com">Zentyal<&#47;a>!<&#47;strong> Of course, we also have a new logo!</p>
<p>After choosing Zentyal as the new name for eBox we obviously needed a logo redesign. It had to transmit Zentyal values, already explained in previous posts, but we also wanted to keep green and orange colors. </p>
<p>Our designer proposed five different drafts, and choosing the definitive one was a funny process. For a week we had all the logos posted on a board, and wrote down what each logo transmitted to us. After some days of talking we reached a quorum, we had a brand new Zentyal logo!</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.zentyal.com"><img src="&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;08&#47;zentyal_logo.png" alt="Zentyal" title="Zentyal logo" width="500" height="161" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>What I most like from this logo is that it keeps the soul of eBox, but with a new identity. I think we all feel very comfortable with it. So, what do you think? I hope you like it too! Feel free to comment here or in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;forum.ebox-platform.com&#47;">forum <&#47;a>!</p>
