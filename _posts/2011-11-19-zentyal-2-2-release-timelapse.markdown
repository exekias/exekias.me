[Zentyal Sumit 2011](http://summit.zentyal.com) is over, and I think we had a very good time, thank you all for coming!

[Heidi](http://blogs.zentyal.org/heidi/) and I did this little video to acknowledge all contributions made by the community ([forum support](http://forum.zentyal.org), [bug reporting](http://trac.zentyal.org/report/3), [translation](http://translate.zentyal.org/), [howto's](http://trac.zentyal.org/wiki/Documentation/Community), patches...). We showed it at the summit, I hope you like it ;)

If you couldn't attend Zentyal Summit take a look at the [presentations](http://events.zentyal.com/zentyal-summit/program/), most of them are already published, I'm sure you will find them interesting! We will also publish videos of each one soon, stay tuned :)
