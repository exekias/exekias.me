{% img right /assets/me.jpg %}

My name is **Carlos Pérez-Aradros Herce**. I was born in Arnedo, a little town in La Rioja, Spain. **Since I was a child I have always enjoyed problem solving**, no matter what kind. I can remember myself playing with mechanics and electricity, from hammer and screwdrivers to K’Nex and small circuits. **I got my first computer at the age of 11, that truncated my career as guitarist :P**

**In 2003 I moved to Zaragoza to course my Computer Science degree**, which I really enjoyed, not only because of the classes but also all the time I passed learning new things, **I discovered Free Software**, Linux, programming, the Internet, the Web.

Currently **I’m working at Server Density** as backend engineer. My interests and experience cover the full web stack, from **system administration** (Linux, networking, protocols, security), **DevOps** (AWS, GCloud, Puppet, Docker, Kubernetes), **backend** (Python, Twisted, Django, Go, C++, Java), and some **frontend** (HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery) **development**.

Besides computing, I also enjoy amateur **photography, I travel as much as I can** and I love playing with **new technology and gadgets**. When I have time I also enjoy electronics, using hardware like Arduino and building stuff that flies.
